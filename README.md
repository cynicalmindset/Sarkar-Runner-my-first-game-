# Sarkar Runner

Sarkar Runner is my first attempt at game development - an endless runner game featuring pixelated graphics and simple gameplay mechanics. Navigate through a mystical forest environment while avoiding obstacles and collecting points to achieve the highest score possible.
As my first game, it's a learning project where I experimented with Godot Engine and basic game mechanics. While it may not be perfect, I'm proud of what I've accomplished as a beginner!
